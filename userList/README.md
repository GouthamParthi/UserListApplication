After downloading the zip file from git repo .
Extract the file and open the folder in the visual studio or any code editor.
Open new terminal.
Direct to UserListApplication/userList/(use cd for changing directory).

"cd userList"

Run "npm install" or "npm i" it will take sometimes to install.
After installing ,
Run "npm start" it will open live demo in browser

UserListApplication is a fully desktop website.I themed the application with Green color.Application will display all the user in Api.if you hover the usernames it will show the details of the user.You can search for a user and add new user which will be stored in Local storage.Note:you cant add user with same name.Pagination is added and I have created a dummy loading animation using css animation

Api folder contains the api where we fetch userdetails

Components folder contains all the component used in this application
AddNewUser--->boostrap modal which open when client clicks addnew button
Animation---->Loading animation while fetching data
Card---->which show the userdetails when client hovers over the users
Search---->It will send the inputValue to filter function
UserDetails ---->it gives all users with navigation button(user for pagination)

Hope you like the application.I am eagerly waiting for your reply
Thank you:)
